Disco is one of the smartest looking and basic (yet powerful) CD/DVD burning solutions for your Mac. Yesterday it was updated with a [maintenance release to V1.0.3][1], which includes quite a number of fixes for crashing that may have occurred. It has been almost 1 year since the last update so this is welcomed.

Incidentally, the developer is offering this software for USD$19.95 (and there is a very good USD->AUD exchange rate) for a [limited time][2].  
Disco has the following features:

  * Disc spanning &#8211; if the total size of the files you&#8217;re burning is bigger than the disc, it tries to divide them amongst multiple discs
  * Discography &#8211; it catalogues all the discs you have burnt for quick searching
  * Multi-session
  * And a pledge to support Blu-ray as soon as it is available on Macs

I&#8217;m not affiliated, just a happy Disco user (Thanks [Mac-Heist][3]!)
