Telstra recently [upgraded their mobile broadband speeds][1] to give &#8220;_&#8230; typical speeds of 550kbps to 3Mbps, bursting up to 6Mbps in CBD, metro and other areas with our BigPond wireless devices on a Super G Fast plan_&#8221;  
While I applaud the expanded infrastructure their pricing makes it useless.  
Take a look at their [business pricing][2] for wireless data:

| Price per month | Data allowance | Excess cost per MB                                         |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $5              | 5 MB           | $1.00                                                      |
| $10             | 20 MB          | $1.00                                                      |
| $29             | 80 MB          | $1.00                                                      |
| $59             | 200 MB         | <del datetime="2008-04-06T11:31:11+00:00">$1.00</del>$0.25 |

There are more expensive ones as well. _Who in their right mind would pay for any of these plans_. With a network that can burst up to 6Mbps, you would exceed your \*5 MEGABYTES\*!!!! in about 5 seconds. You would then be paying $1 per MB.  
If they had the best infrastructure AND competitive pricing, everyone would flock to them.  
I will continue to use my 3G bluetooth vodafone for data thank you very much Sol.
