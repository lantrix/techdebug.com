I was looking at CelticBear&#8217;s blog, and saw a link to MSNBC, who has a [piece by Keith Olbermann with comments about President Bush][1] and his recent speech about Iraq. He likens Bush to the boy who cried wolf, noting that this time around, who will believe him that the same thing will work (sending another 20K troops to Iraq). I **highly recommend** watching the streaming video, as it conveys the commentators opinions much better than the written piece.

One of the things I personally find strange in the Presidents comments in recent days, is a response he [made to leaders of congress][2] post his speech.

> He put it far more bluntly when leaders of Congress visited the White House earlier on Wednesday. “I said to Maliki this has to work or you’re out,” the president told the Congressional leaders, according to two officials who were in the room. Pressed on why he thought this strategy would succeed where previous efforts had failed, Mr. Bush shot back: “Because it has to.”

But then again, a lot of his rhetoric is strange to me. Is this another Vietnam? Kung Fu Monkey&#8217;s blog has a interesting [comparison of George Bush to Leeroy Jenkins][3], for those of you gaming geeks that play World of Warcraft. I find the comparison quite apt.

All this aside, I support our Aussie troops (including my family) 100% who are in Iraq. They have a job to do, and they need the best equipment, leadership and support from the public.
