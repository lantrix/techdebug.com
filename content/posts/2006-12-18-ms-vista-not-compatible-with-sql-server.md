This is an [article by Fortune&#8217;s Owen Thomas][1] on Vista not being compatible with SQL Server. An excerpt:

> &#8216;But now Microsoft has a problem. Vista, its long-awaited update to the Windows operating system, can&#8217;t run the current version of SQL Server. The company is working on a SQL upgrade that is compatible with Vista &#8211; called SQL Server 2005 Express Service Pack 2 &#8211; but it&#8217;s in beta and can be licensed only for testing purposes. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t set a release date for the new SQL program.&#8217; 

Microsoft is making the world worse with Vista.

That&#8217;s two of their own products not compatible. Zune and SQL2005. Another good reason to use a nicer operating system, like [OpenBSD][2], [Mac OSX][3] or if you&#8217;re in the corporate world [Solaris][4]
