If you&#8217;re a tech head, and you&#8217;ve been around Object Orientated languages &#8211; then you&#8217;ve surely heard of [Ruby][1].

I&#8217;ve been [around people][2] who are [passionate about Ruby][3], but never caught the bug. What I did do whilst others were programming away, was read about ruby. One day whilst reading I came across the name of an online persona [Why the lucky stiff][4], also known as _why.

Plenty of people have ensured his code and writing not only live on but continue, and you can read more of his eccentric writings [at his estate][6].

However, my interest here is his book: _[Why&#8217;s (poignant) Guide to Ruby][7]_

Some have innocuously [declared][8] the 19th of August as &#8220;[Why Day][9]&#8220;. What better way to celebrate knowledge than to start reading a book, and why not read the guide book itself?! I&#8217;m just a regular old person, so far unaware of Ruby and its
