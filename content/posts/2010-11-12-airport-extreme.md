What a difference a new router makes.

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/150px-Airportextreme.jpg" alt="Old Airport Extreme" title="Old Airport Extreme" width="150" height="122" class="alignright size-full wp-image-766" /> I&#8217;ve been using the old Apple Airport extreme, 2nd generation, for about 8 years now. It&#8217;s been rock solid, and provided wireless access almost 24&#215;7 for the whole 8 years.

Lately, things have been getting flakey. Trying to control my Mac Mini Boxee on the TV was laggy &#8211; and remoting to other desktops flaky. So today, I purchased an upgrade.

I was looking at the Cisco/Linksys offerings as I use a few at work, but when using a NAS device I would have had to reformat my existing HFS+ drives. I compared the Linksys E3000 model with the new Airport Extreme, and for $50 more, it seemed the Airport just fitted right in to my mac network. Well of course it would, Apples for Apples. The last thing to convince me was the 4.5 out of 5 star rating for the Airport extreme on the Apple Store &#8211; and a [review from SmallNetBuilder][1].

Here I am &#8211; first blog post on the new wireless network. [Simultaneous dual band speeeeeed][2].

It was simple to setup. Plugin, configure with the Apple Airport Utility (the CD has both Mac and PC versions included) and then I plugged in my Hard Drive. It gets shared, and used across all the Macs.

Check out the speed differences, before and after:
