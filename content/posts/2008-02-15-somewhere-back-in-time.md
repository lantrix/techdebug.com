I have a short video I took of the Somewhere in Time Tour. It&#8217;s from the Powerslave guitar solo as played in Sydney. If you were at [either][1] of the [events][2] this should bring back some good memories!



For a review of the evening in Melbourne, synultima has a [blow by blow review over [@][3]{.tweet-username} last.fm][4]

On a side note, some bloke [taped a bootleg copy of the 9th Feb show][5] &#8211; you can get it while you can, but I can&#8217;t condone that.
