Only 2 months ago I [wrote][1] that Gmail had hit 4GB, but it was still behind the main crowd (MSN, Yahoo, etc).  
Well in time for the new year, they have finally hit the 6GB (not 6GiB yet!) limit. This was initially picked up by a number of bloggers including [WikiGiz][2] and [BBCentral][3].  
I&#8217;ve totally cutover to Gmail since they enabled IMAP and [I figured][4] out how to turn it on. Apple Mail now accesses gmail as my only mail account, and I get everything synced between the web interface and Mail.app including read/unread, starred/flagged and the labels/folders.  
With this very quick increase of 1GB per month over the last two months, who knows where they will go next.
