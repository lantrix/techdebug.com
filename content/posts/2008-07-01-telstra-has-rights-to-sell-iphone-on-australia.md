Telstra have now announced they will be selling the iPhone as well. According to [the Age][1], since Telstra&#8217;s NextG network covers 99% of the population the iPhone will get good coverage due to it using the 850Mhz 3G frequencies.

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" src='https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/450px-iphone_black_bg.thumbnail.JPG' alt='iPhone' /> 

Additionally the Age have [reported][2] on the pricing Telstra will offer on their bundles:

> The cheapest monthly plan will be $30, paying either $279 upfront for an eight-gigabyte iPhone or $399 for a 16Gb model. Customers who do not want to pay upfront could sign up to an $80 plan for the 8Gb model or a $100 plan for the 16Gb model.

I&#8217;ll still opting Vodafone for now, but lets see what the Vodafone pricing and data usage policy will be compare to Telstra&#8217;s. If they are almost the same (and I doubt it) it could prompt me to jump carrier. The coverage that NextG have is unrivalled in this country &#8211; but has been pricey to use for data so far. SMH Blogger Adam Turner correctly [speculates][3] that even though the pricing is out, there is no mention of data usage. Don&#8217;t get too hyped about Telstra&#8217;s offering just yet. Despite the fantastic infrastructure they are usually the most expensive.

Just to show I&#8217;m not entirely biased, Telstra are taking pre-registrations at their [website][4]. Thanks to [@IdleThoughts][5]{.tweet-username} for the heads up on this.
