You may have noticed that my last 3 posts were about free software.  
I like free stuff. Everyone likes free stuff. Why talk about free stuff?

A [friend told me][1] that the reason he enjoys using Open Source (and usually free) apps is he can customise them. He finds it frustrating that when you pay $1K per seat for an application like [Mercury][2] (now owned by HP) that sometimes it just wont do what you need. You either work with the (often times) limited and expensive tool, or you extend the functions using your own coding and software.

You can keep up with 90kts and his Open Source load testing efforts [on his blog][3].

Everyone likes free stuff.
