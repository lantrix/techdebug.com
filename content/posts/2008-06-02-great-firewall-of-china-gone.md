An friend of mine who lives in China recently wrote to me and said &#8220;guess what.. the great firewall of China seems to be gone&#8230;&#8221; My friend advised that you can read anything you like.

An example of this is the UK BBC news site, who a few months ago [reported][1] that their English site is available inside China for first time in a decade; but the point of interest is that the [BBC Chinese site][2] is also available for use within China.

A quick search, by my friend from within China, for [tiananmen][3], [dalai lama][4] and [taiwan][5] yields links to articles that seems to make it evident that the so called [Red Firewall][6] doesn&#8217;t reset connections anymore.

Is this a show to the world that China is no longer the perceived oppressor of their own peoples right to information? A way to &#8220;shake-hands&#8221; with the world before the upcoming Olympics? This possible change in policy or network filtering [may re-enable other people][7] to test the status of the filtering once again.

Whether it will stay that way permanently remains to be seen.
