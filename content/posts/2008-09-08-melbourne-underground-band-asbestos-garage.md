As regular readers of my blog will know, I&#8217;m a fan of metal, progressive rock and a bit of eighties rock. The other day I had the chance to speak to the lead singer of [Asbestos Garage][1], a Melbourne based band. Neon Kessler told me of their aspirations to bring glam rock back to Melbourne, and not one of mega-concerts &#8211; but something you can enjoy at your local pub. With the up-coming Def Leppard [concert][2] in Melbourne this appears to be the right time to do so.

The band is currently promoting their fantastic [T-Shirts][3] to raise the funds to go on tour possibly some time in the near future. I personally will be buying the [black design][4].

I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing their 2007 promo/demo track &#8220;_The Will To Breathe_&#8220;, which can hopefully be released on an independent label soon. Neon advised it is planned as their opening track on their EP &#8220;_Fire Proof Rock_&#8220;.

If by chance a music label reads this you can contact the band on the email neon at asbestos garage dot com.
