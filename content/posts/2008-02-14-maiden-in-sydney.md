A quick note to say I put up the [Iron Maiden photos at flickr][1] from the Saturday gig in Sydney.

These ones where taken with a better camera, so they came out pretty decent for being 5 meters from the stage!

The setlist was great, and it was well worth getting Gold floor tickets. As for Acer Arena, they banned all bags and drinks being bought in (including water!) unlike Melbourne. That was annoying as I had to run back to the cloakroom to get my earplugs ([33dB reduction!][2]).  
The crowd in Sydney were good but not quite into it as Melbourne. All in all it was a good night and these guys still give top notch performances.
