I thought people understood this simple premise. You write your code to the standard, not to the browser. The browsers then adhering to the standard display the code correctly, or lay it out based upon the chosen style.

Why in this day and age are Telstra/Bigpond NOT doing this?

I am a customer, and nearly all their web based products MANDATE the use of a single browser; i.e. they write their code to a platform.

  * Bigpond TV. [Internet Explorer only][1]
  * Bigpond Movies. [Internet Explorer only][2] (select topic 8, then system requirements)

And now the Bigpond home page. This is how their home page is rendering in Safari

The only reason I&#8217;m still using them is that they are the fastest broadband option available to me where I live. Otherwise I would drop this Microsoft Addicted ISP like a hot potato.
