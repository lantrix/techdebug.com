I wonder&#8230;. what will the new year bring?  
Well besides tomorrow being the same as every other day, will I finish reading all those books I started? Will I finish learning postgreSQL, php, css, xhtml, xml, shell scripting, do my w2k3 exams, finish reading my science book, my coding book, my DB book, my novel, reading the bible?

Will I do more geocaching, spend more time with kids, do more exercise, lose weight, be a better husband/father/brother/son, find my inner self, understand the universe, etc.?

Why will it be any different?  
One thing I can say is: I finally finished my www/DB server and got my blog online!

Maybe there is hope for me yet.
