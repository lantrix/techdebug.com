I am currently travelling. and am in Adelaide this week; Flying with Qantas. Besides getting up at 3am, all is good with today. I have started eating at 3 hourly intervals, smaller meals, in an attempt to get my metabolism kickstarted. This is still on a calorie intake 20% less than my Base Metabolic Rate (approx. 2100 per day). Combine this with my jogging, and I should see some results over the next few months.

To keep this &#8216;technical&#8217;, this will be my first post from my Palm T5. It connects via bluetooth over a 3G mobile. Neato.
