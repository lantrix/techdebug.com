[Some][1] [friends][2] and I were discussing the benefits of using Open Source software which is low cost or free ([as in beer][3]) versus the equivalent Commercial and close source products. Examples of comparison were

  * Photoshop vs. Gimp
  * Apache HTTPD vs. IIS
  * Windows vs. Open Solaris/OpenBSD/Linux etc.

It seems like we are not the only ones thinking about this topic. Slashdot today [posted][4] that CNET has a feature promoting Open Source application alternatives for the average home user, if only to reduce software costs to the end user. It does not include Operating Systems in comparison, so this article appears to be aimed at Windows users.
