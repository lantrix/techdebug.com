I&#8217;m lagging so far behind on wordpress that I&#8217;m probably breaking all the security rules.  
So in an effort to be more proactive in online open-source communities I&#8217;m giving WordPress V2.7 [Release Candidate 1][1] a whirl. Looking forward to the new Admin UI.

Does anyone else ride the bleeding edge when it comes to tech blogging?

**Edit:** The upgrade worked. 2.7 RC1 even worked with all my 2.3 plugins straight up!
