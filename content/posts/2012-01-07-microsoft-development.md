I&#8217;ve started down the path of Darkness ðŸ™‚

In December 2011, I went on BizTalk training with [@BizTalkBill][1] and I&#8217;m now four weeks into the next stage of my career which is being an Microsoft &#8220;Integration Specialist&#8221;. You won&#8217;t find any open source in this realm, no ruby, nothing involving indie developers cracking out code until late at night.

What this change means is getting to know Visual Studio, BizTalk, SQL Server and all things Microsoft. It means using TFS, even though you really want to use Git. It means C[#][2]{.tweet-hashtag} coding when you are familiar with interpreted languages like Perl, PHP and Ruby (I won&#8217;t be doing an ASP work).

That means you can expect going forward less posts about Unix, Clearcase (finally!) and Open Source platforms, and more about Microsoft offerings; specifically integration products.

Welcome to 2012.
