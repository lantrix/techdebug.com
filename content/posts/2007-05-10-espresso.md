  Came across this coffee bar in Adelaide recently, called <a href="http://www.uncaffebar.com/">Un Caff√© Bar</a>. Besides me liking the taste of illy coffee, it was a simple layout designed for only one thing. Coffee. They have a few bars in Adelaide. I think melbourne could do with some of these as well.<br /> <br clear="all" />
