Of interest to most &#8220;Tech&#8221; people out there would be the chat between Steve Jobs (of Apple fame if you are from under a rock) and Bill Gates (of Microsoft fame if you are not in the know). This occurred at the [All Things Digital][1] conference, and is now available for your [aural or visual pleasure on the iTunes Music Store][2] in the form of an audio and video podcast.
