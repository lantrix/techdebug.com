I&#8217;ve started blogging from [textmate][1]. And this is one of my recent posts using this app.  
A friend uses Textmate and swears by it as his main text editor, so here I am using it more often (Thanks [Tim][2]). I&#8217;m still a dab hand at vim, BUT now that I can blog from textmate, then its looking like my licence will finally get some use.  
From where I stand using the Mac is soooo much more than just jumping on a computer to bang out some email. And all you converts I have turned to the white side, know it oh so well.  
Check out textmate for your mac if text editing is your thing. You can&#8217;t go wrong.
