Watched a video linked from a work memo today. Its a good reminder for people in Australia as we go into winter, with the flu, and all sorts of nasties spread by coughs and sneezes.

[Why Don&#8217;t We Do It In Our Sleeves?][1]. This covers how to sneeze and/or cough into our sleeves. The experts say that germs on cloth die out pretty quickly, whereas coughing into our hands spreads the germs onto everything we then decide to touch&#8230;. eeeewwww. Should you actually sneeze or cough into your hands, wash them immediately.

So think about this next time you are sitting in a crowded train or tram. **This is also aimed at YOU &#8211; YES YOU &#8211; people sitting in offices who insist on coming to work even though they are coughing every 5 minutes.**

[Watch the Video!!!][2] It is very informative.

If people don&#8217;t take heed of this sort of advice I will have to break the cycle fashion mould and start wearing a surgical mask. Being a geek, I already get singled out for my fashion and quirks, so why not a mask?!!
