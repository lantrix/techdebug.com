Jonathan Schwartz the SUN CTO [detailed on his blog][1] about the new deal between Sun and IBM that allows IBM to offer Solaris x86 as a supported OS on their hardware. What does this mean for sysadmins around the world? More Solaris. That&#8217;s OK in my books. The less windows servers the better.  
Someone [should tell IBM][2] about their new interest.
