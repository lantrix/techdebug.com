I know it has been blogged to death by now, but Mac OSX, my desktop OS of choice, is now [officially a standard UNIX][1]. Specifically to the UNIX 03 Product Standard. This confirms it conforms to [Version 3 of the Single UNIX Specification][2]. This makes Apple Inc. an official UNIX vendor along with all the other big boys.

On the serverside, I will stick with [OpenBSD][3] as my personal server OS of choice, with Solaris following close behind.
