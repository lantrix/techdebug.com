Recently Gmail activated IMAP for selected accounts, and I appeared to not be one of them. However was it really for selected accounts or was it for &#8216;selected languages&#8217;?!

Reading about gmail on digg led me to [an un-dug comment][1] (I gave him a thumbs up!) saying that for IMAP to appear your language in gmail had to be set to &#8216;English (US)&#8217;. So I gave it a try, as I had mine on &#8216;English (UK)&#8217; for the spelling. I logged into gmail, went to my &#8216;General&#8217; settings and changed the language to &#8216;English (US)&#8217;, and saved the settings.

_Lo &#8211; under settings, the IMAP option was now enabled!_

As a test, I thought I would set my language settings back to &#8216;English (UK)&#8217; and see what happens. Would you belive it turns it back off again.

Re-activating IMAP is as simple as using the US variation of the English language again.

I&#8217;m [not][2] [the][3] [first][4] to [notice][5] this though.

I&#8217;m not sure if this activates or deactivates the actual IMAP on your account, but it certainly makes the settings show or hide it. I wonder why Google thinks that only US speaking people should have access to IMAP. All the gmail users in the UK or Australia &#8211; take note if you want IMAP! With 5GB available now, it is even better.
