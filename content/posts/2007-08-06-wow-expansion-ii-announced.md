Logging on to Warcraft on the weekend, I note that a [new expansion has been announced][1] at Blizzcon. It features Arthas as Lich King, no doubt in some mega dungeon that you and 25 of your closest friends get to take down. In addition there is new land to the north including buildings you can take down &#8211; towers, etc. &#8211; very reminiscent of Warcraft3 for all you old school gamers.

A new level cap of 80 as well&#8230; I can&#8217;t even get to 60. The cap of the original game.
