Now that we know the 3G iPhone is coming to Australia in July, I was reading back through the pre-announcment 3G rumours to see what where true. Late last month, Afterdawn wrote that according to an anonymous insider, the iPhone will be [faster on Telstra][1] by the end of 2008.

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" src="https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/iphone.png" alt="iPhone" height="354" width="170" /> 

If you follow through and read their referenced article at [Electronista][2] then the story changes slightly. They state that the iPhone will allegedly support up to 42Mbps by the end of 2008 in Australia (on NextG is inferred) &#8220;_according to a senior offical_&#8220;.

One more click through to the claim at [ITNews][3] and the referenced senior official is actually Sol Trujilo the Telstra CEO; and **the article doesn&#8217;t mention anything about the iPhone**. It is about Telstra offering a HSDPA+ service via their NextG by end of 2008.

The 3G iPhone does actually support the [NextG][4] frequencies which operate on [850 Mhz][5]. The technical specifications on Apples iPhone [page][6] show that the 3G unit works on UMTS/HSDPA frequencies of 850, 1900 and 2100 MHz. This doesn&#8217;t mean the 3G chipset actually supports these NextG speeds.

Telstra have [not yet][7] announced the iPhone to be available through them despite Optus and Vodafone issuing press releases intending to carry the phone.

And now we come to the price. Stevie J announced in his [Keynote Speech][8] that the price of the 8GB model would not exceed USD$199 even in other countries. That comes in at about _AUD$210 for an iPhone 3G 8GB_ at todays exchange rate. Historically there is a severe markup of 30% or more on products sole in Australia out of the USA, made by Apple.

We will see where there goes in the near future when pricing is actually announced. I&#8217;ll see you all with your new iPhone in July!
