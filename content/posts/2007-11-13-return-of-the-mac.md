I have my [Powerbook G4][1] back now. _Woooot!_ It has a fresh install of 10.4.6 on it from the Mac repair shop. 

The question is, what do I do with my CCC backup firewire HDD? Clone it back? Migrate it back? 

Having watched others roll into 10.5 aka Leopard, I thought it would be time for me to roll into a fresh computer as well. Sans postgresql, custom php install, CVS repository and the last 2 years of installed junk. (Not saying CVS/PHP/PostgreSQL are junk!) 

So I&#8217;m doing it. I&#8217;m migrating. A fresh install &#8211; and we will see how good it is. The advantage? A newer faster install.Disadvantages? Days spend getting things right again. But that iss the fun part for a geek! If we can&#8217;t tweek, what else is there. 

I&#8217;ll keep you posted on how it goes.
