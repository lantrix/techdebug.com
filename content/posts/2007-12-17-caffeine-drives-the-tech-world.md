A number of weeks ago I gave up caffeine, and was pretty OK with that. But, I have come to the conclusion that there is a direct correlation with Caffeine and all other things tech, including tech blogging.

As you may have noticed if you subscribed to my feed, or read this site, my posts have been minimal.

Yet after having caffeine on the weekend in an energy drink, and subsequently picking up where I left of with [decent illy coffee][1], I have had the urge to blog again. Nothing tech yet &#8211; but here I am.

I&#8217;m back baby!
