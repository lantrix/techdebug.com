An excerpt from an [MSNBC article about China][1] and another crazy law:

> In one of history&#8217;s more absurd acts of totalitarianism, China has banned Buddhist monks in Tibet from reincarnating without government permission. According to a statement issued by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the law, which goes into effect next month and strictly stipulates the procedures by which one is to reincarnate, is &#8220;an important move to institutionalize management of reincarnation.&#8221;

How odd.
