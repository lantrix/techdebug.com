I can feel it&#8230;.. Hot on the heels of iPhone [release rumours][1], TUAW [post the rumour][2] about iPhone on Vodafone in Australia; and the [SMH follow][3] soon thereafter based upon the actual [press release][4] from Vodafone.  
[<img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; border: 0px" src='https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/madeonamac20050720.gif' alt='Made on a Mac' />][5]

June is just around the corner and my current Vodafone contract runs out this month. Perfect timing.  
The reason I was hoping for Vodafone is this: with a $79 cap, the $500 credit (currently) covers 3G data usage. You pay $1 per 5 minute block out of your cap. Its totally different how Telstra charge: $60 per month on top for data and [$0.25 per MB][6].

Since I make about $100 of calls in a month, that&#8217;s $400 of included data in my cap; or 33 constant hours of 3G data. But wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Vodafone shifted to an untimed/uncounted data plan for the iPhone. That is the ultimate Geek Nirvana.
