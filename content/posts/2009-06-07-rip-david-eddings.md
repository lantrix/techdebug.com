I just read on Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s [blog][1] that David Eddings, the author of some fantastic fantasy books, has recently [passed away][2].

I started reading fantasy novels early on in high school. After reading the Lord of the Rings, the Belgariad series by David Eddings were instrumental in forming my enjoyment of this genre of books.

Unfortunately I lent my Belgariad series to someone and never got them back. I also never finished the Mallorean. It&#8217;s high time to raise your glasses to [David][3] (and his co-author/wife Leigh) for a story that started many of us on our journey of a lifetime.

Time to buy a new set of [the Belgariad][4] and after 21 years re-read them.
