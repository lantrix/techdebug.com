So the footage from my [previous post][1] was is not a new occurrence.

zorgon; a member of AboveTopSecret.com mentions in the [NASA UFO STS-120 External Fuel Tank thread][2] that there is similar footage shot during the same maneuver of [STS-115][3]. As I previously posted, NASA uses handheld cams to capture this footage for analysis of the tank for damage.



Once again it is a spiny like object, similar in colour to the previous crystalline structure seen on STS-120. Think about this for a minute, then watch both videos again. What is going on that we are treated like [mushrooms][4] about? You can continue to follow the discussion about this object [on this post][2] at ATS.
