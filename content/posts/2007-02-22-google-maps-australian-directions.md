I was playing around with a side project of mine, a web site in [Joomla][1], and I added some XSLT to allow users to get directions in the [Google maps component][2] of this particular Joomla site. Besides the fact that I&#8217;m enjoying playing around with this CMS, I am also learning new things.

One of them was the fact that I discovered you can now get driving directions for Australian addresses in google maps now! Check out [this example of driving directions][3] you may want to use if you find yourself in Sydney.
