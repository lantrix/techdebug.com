The [Circle Six blog has some good info][1] on wordpress theme design on a mac:

> &#8220;Having spit out several WordPress custom sites in the last few days, I thought I&#8217;d detail my current workflow on my Macintosh OSX platform for posterity &#8230; A brief summary to begin with &#8230; This post will confine itself to the tools required to create a custom theme for WordPress without hacking the core code. However, all of the tools that are mentioned are powerful enough to handle such tasks and I don&#8217;t use any additional tools to do my core hacking.&#8221;

Looks like I can have a go at designing my own theme sometime soon.
