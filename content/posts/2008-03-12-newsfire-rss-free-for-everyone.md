David Watanabe announced the most recent upgrade to Newsfire RSS as now [_free for all users_][1]. In David&#8217;s own words, he explains what the buzz about news aggregation is, and why Newsfire is a must for ALL mac users:

> For those new to this, NewsFire is a news reader for blogs, news sites, and anything else that publishes an ‘RSS’ syndication feed. It watches for news so you don’t have to. When a new story is published, NewsFire brings it to your attention with some super-slick animation. Unlike other readers, NewsFire is designed with a deliberately minimal interface. The news is what matters and it takes center stage.
