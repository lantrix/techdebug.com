About 24 months ago I purchased a version of KavaSoft&#8217;s Translation Service application for the Mac. With the recent move from my old Powerbook to my new MacBookPro the application stopped working. Apparently the licence is tied not just to your purchase but to the computer you installed it on.

As I had used the Apple migration tool to move everything across to the new laptop, Translation Service stopped working. I dropped an email to the developer and _literally got an email response 60 minutes later_ with an updated licence.

Now that&#8217;s customer service! There is nothing like a Mac application developer to renew your faith in customer service. After dealing with so many large companies for other IT support issues (Telstra I&#8217;m looking at you) &#8211; it is very refreshing to get such a favourable response. I&#8217;m a happy user and can still translate the odd French or Italian comments on flickr photo-streams I look at. 

There is an updated version of Translation Services called [KavaServices which sells for $20][1] and it does a whole lot of other conversion as well. I&#8217;m nothing more than a happy customer. The application is perfect for quick on the fly internet based language translation, and even translate right in the browser. Seen here are before/after shots from a [flickr photo page][2].

**After Translation** &#8211; _directly in the browser_!

Thanks Kavasoft for the enjoyable support experience.
