I received and email from the MacHeist directorate today. The [controversy][1] has been solved by YazSoft offering a free upgrade to Speed Download 5 for MacHeist customers, _but only for a very limited time_ &#8211; March 13 2008 until March 27 2008.  
It is nice that I got the email, albeit 5 days after the offer was extended.

This list of changes that come with SD5 are [available online][2].

So if you purchased Speed Download 4 with MacHeist II, and choose to upgrade, then [proceed to yazsoft&#8217;s website in a quick and orderly fashion][3] to get the upgrade offer.
