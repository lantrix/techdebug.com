Growl has been updated to V1.1.1. This is a _MUST HAVE_ application for any Mac user, and without any further hesitation you can [download it from the growl homepage][1].

Growl provides notifications, which &#8220;&#8230; are a way for your applications to provide you with new information, without you having to switch from the application you&#8217;re already in.&#8221;
