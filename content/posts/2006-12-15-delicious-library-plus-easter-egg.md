I&#8217;ve just bought a copy of [Delicious Library][1] for my mac via [MacHeist][2]. Its a great app. I have started scanned all my barcodes of DVDs/Books/CDs via my iSight camera. Awesome. I can then track who I lend them to, etc. Also great for Insurance. You get a view like a bookshelf of all the items with coverart.

I also found an Easter egg. When I added all my [Star Wars Trilogy DVDs][3] the voice that talks the disc name says &#8220;Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI) [1977]&#8221; then it Whispers &#8220;I am your Father&#8221;. Nice.
