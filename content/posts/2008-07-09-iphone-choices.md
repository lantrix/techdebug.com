As I posted late last night &#8211; Vodafone had not announced their pricing. They did &#8211; then [retracted it][1]. This is a major factor for an IT and tech geek who currently uses Vodafone. I&#8217;m now seriously thinking of taking my business to Telstra (I use them for Cable and Internet already &#8211; so&#8230;?!). I have partially ruled Optus out due to their lack of non-metro coverage and decisions to expand their 3G using 900Mhz technologies.

I tried to pre-register with Telstra. They still have sent me as much as Vodafone. **Nothing**. So I decide that pre-registering is a waste of time. Off to the stores I went:

  * A Melbourne CBD Vodafone store &#8211; &#8220;Sorry we don&#8217;t have any information yet&#8221;
  * A Melbourne CBD Optus Store &#8211; &#8220;I can&#8217;t find the flyers so I don&#8217;t know the data rates, but I think you get the 16GB for $2 a month on the $80 cap&#8221;
  * Telstra&#8217;s T-Life Melbourne store &#8211; &#8220;There is no info in store, come back Friday&#8221;

The Telstra bloke actually spent most of the subsequent three or so minutes expanding on my coverage comment. He mentioned &#8220;3.5G&#8221; at least 5 times, even when I said that the iPhone is a 3G device; _not_ specifically catered to the NextG higher speeds (14Mbps).

So it is left up to me to ignore all the bally-hoo and just make a decision.

As [Koops][2] tells me: &#8220;Just buy one from elsewhere and use your computer data card to tether it via wifi&#8221;. Maybe that will be the way I go too. It&#8217;s either going to be a Friday morning purchase, or stick with my old nokia for another couple of months.

Bottom line, Vodafone <del datetime="2008-07-09T13:54:22+00:00">has</del> may have (see late minute [official][3] pricing) lost a customer &#8211; They missed the opportunity to NOT think of this as just another phone.
