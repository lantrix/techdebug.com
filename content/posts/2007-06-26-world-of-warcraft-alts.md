I&#8217;ve hit level 50 with my [main character][1] now. Whilst I want to get another 10 levels and start on the BC content, I have found the gold I make farming with this character, particularly on recipes, enables me to spec out my alts like never before.

So I started a hunter. I already have [him up to level 12][2] and besides being a bit time consuming, its fun. Playing a hunter is like being in a 2 man group all the time. The pet tanks, and I get my range attacks taking down the target before they hit me.

I also have a [lvl 24 pally][3] whom I&#8217;ve spec&#8217;ed up the same. A lvl 21 [Guardian Blade][4] is the two handed sword of choice for my crusader, though it costs 15 Gold on my server from the AH.

I&#8217;ve found that having my main as an enchanter means I can also buy the items I want, enchant them and mail them on. The only problem remains: when if ever will the main get to level 60, or even 70!
