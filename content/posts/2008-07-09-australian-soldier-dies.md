<img style="float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10px" src='https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/rasigs_t.gif' alt='RASIGS' /> My petty whinging about iPhone prices and data really means nothing.

My thoughts go out to the family of the [recently killed Australian Solder][1]. Since I have a number of family and friends whom are serving members (some overseas) &#8211; I have a very small idea how they must feel. I&#8217;m an ex-military and ex-Signaller myself: so I know how committed one can be to the job and the corps. 

I&#8217;m going to keep quiet about tech stuff and remember that Sean McCarthy died for his country; no matter what political and social issues are behind all the hell in the Middle East.
