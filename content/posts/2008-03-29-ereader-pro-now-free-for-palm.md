I use eReader on my Palm, but only for free documents and not often enough to warrant paying for it.

As I noticed at the [downloadsquad][1], eReader Pro for Palm and Windows mobile devices is now being offered for free.

If you would like your own copy for Palm (or windows mobile) you can [download it from the ereader website][2].
