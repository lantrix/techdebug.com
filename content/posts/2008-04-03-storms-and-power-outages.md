We&#8217;ve had some stong winds in Melbourne yesterday. Up to 130 kph!  
These winds were good enough to cause a 24 hour extended power outage in my area, meaning my provider had upstream outages and the internet connection was down. Add that to the errant html comment in my last post which made the whole page commented out.  
All resolved now. Now what else do I have to debug that is technical?
