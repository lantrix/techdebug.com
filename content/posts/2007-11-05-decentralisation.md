With my [recent loss][1], I had thought about, and seen other people, decentralising data. Luckily I&#8217;ve already got an email and RSS feed backup in place.

As soon as my Laptop was out of order, I jumped onto my [pobox.com][2] account and redirected email to Gmail. Gmail will keep my mail flow going for a week or two.

Next I went over to Google reader and reset all my feeds. Previously I had exported all my subscribed [Newsfire RSS][3] subscriptions to [OPML][4] format, and imported it into google reader. Thats blogs and news covered. Google is storing a lot of our data, so for now thats a good thing.

I&#8217;m lucky my iPod has all my music still, so tunes and [pod][5] [casts][6] are covered

The judicious use of [Del.icio.us][7] means all my bookmarks are already online.

This online decentralisation of my data should hold me out till I get the laptop repaired. Looks like with minimal effort, I am able to function without the laptop as an IT worker bee. It just goes to show how web2.0 is no longer a buzz word, but standard practice. Data out there, in communities.

On the theme of iTunes recovery, I had purchased [iPodRip][8] to get my music to the laptop. It didn&#8217;t work as advertised for me &#8211; The iPod Recover feature imported the songs to some temp folder, but never put them into iTunes. 2 hours later I had finished manually importing my missing 257 songs from the iPod into the CCC backup drive. A waste of $20? I will wait till the support team get back to me before I conclude that.
