Nearly ALL windows apps I use are CTRL+F to start a new find&#8230; On my mac, APPLE+F .

Microsoft apps:  
Office = F4 for find, SHIFT F4 to find next.  
Outlook (part of office but yet different!) = CTRL+E

What tha?!!!! Just hope in word that you don&#8217;t bump ALT+F4 in office or it will close your window!
