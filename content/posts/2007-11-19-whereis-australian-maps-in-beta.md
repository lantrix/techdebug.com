For a long time I used google maps over the local provider, [WhereiS][1] (a Telstra/Sensis product). Even though google maps had less local content, WhereiS was so 1999 in its web design that it was unusable. Basic dragging of the maps which is now a staple of so [many][2] [online][3] map providers, was one of the basic missing pieces of functionality.

But recently they have updated their online maps, which [can now be accessed][4] as a Beta version.

While this is a good thing for local and businesses and content, in the time they took to bring this to market, google have already bought their Australian content &#8220;up to speed&#8221;. Is this too little too late from Sensis &#8211; or will the existing users who used the YellowPages and WhereiS content be happy for the improvement?

[Try WhereiS maps BETA][4] and judge for yourself.
