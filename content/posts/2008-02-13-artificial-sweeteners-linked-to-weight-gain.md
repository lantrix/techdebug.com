ScienceDaily [have an article][1] on new research on artificial sweeteners.

> Want to lose weight? It might help to pour that diet soda down the drain. Researchers have laboratory evidence that the widespread use of no-calorie sweeteners may actually make it harder for people to control their intake and body weight. Cutting the connection between sweets and calories may confuse the body, making it harder to regulate intake.

Personally, I have never ascribed to the need for artificial sweeteners. If I want to sweeten my food, I will use a natural product like cane sugar, and as raw as possible. I also reject diet drinks and diet foods. Your &#8220;diet&#8221; is merely your food intake as a whole. If you want to be &#8220;on a diet&#8221; then alter your food intake and type on a permanent ongoing basis. Not just for a set period.

On a side note; I often think about going completely raw with my food but find it difficult to reconcile with eating in our modern society as a whole. **Food for thought**.
