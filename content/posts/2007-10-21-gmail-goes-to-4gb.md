I was logged into [Gmail][1] today and noticed it states **You are currently using 92 MB (2%) of your _4044 MB_**. This is close to a doubling of the email capacity for normal accounts. I&#8217;m not sure if this applies to all users, or gets applied progressively, but it is a fantastic number to see at the bottom of your inbox.

<del datetime="2007-10-22T14:34:34+00:00">In comparison, Windows live (aka hotmail) <a href="http://skydriveteam.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!977F793E846B3C96!124.entry">offers 1GB to their users</a>, albeit in the form of a &#8220;<a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&#038;rpsnv=10&#038;ct=1192939947&#038;rver=4.5.2130.0&#038;wp=MBI&#038;wlcxt=title&#038;wreply=http:%2F%2Fskydrive.live.com%2Fwelcome.aspx&#038;id=250206&#038;lc=1033">Skydrive</a>&#8220;</del>. Skydrive is an online storage space.

**Correction:** Thanks to [Taylor&#8217;s comment][2], I do note that as a Windows live user my inbox shows 5GB of space available. <del datetime="2007-10-23T02:07:57+00:00">Methinks Microsoft are playing catchup! Too little too late? We shall see, as both services are still the most popular (where are you yahoo!)</del>

As detailed in the comments, Microsoft were actually offering Windows Live users more than Gmail sometime over 2 months ago. As I use Gmail primarily it slipped by my radar.

As I use both, I may review them in detail sometime.
