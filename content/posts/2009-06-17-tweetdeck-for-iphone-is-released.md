I used to use Tweetdeck, until Tweetie came out for the Mac (a native client). However on any other non-apple platform I recommend Tweetdeck or DestroyTwitter (both Adobe Air apps) to my friends.

In the last 24 hours Kevin Rose, of Digg fame, [blogged][1] about getting hold of the Tweetdeck beta. Since then the blogosphere has gone mad about it. Mashable [reports][2] that the app is now live in the Apple appstore.

You can get it for free [from the App Store][3].
