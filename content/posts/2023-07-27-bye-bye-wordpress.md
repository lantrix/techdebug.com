A long time coming, no more databases, VPS or wordpress installs.

This [move to Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) has been a fun train of

- Terraforming an AWS S3 static site behind Cloudfront for TLS.
- Setting up Hugo to publish to S3
- Doing this all in GitHub Actions.

So far it's just the content. Media and comments still need to be figured out.

I still haven't figured out the home page either.

You can check it all out on [GitHub](https://github.com/lantrix/techdebug.com).
