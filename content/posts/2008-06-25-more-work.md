I&#8217;m not posting much these days since I&#8217;m currently heavily involved in a current development and build effort for a Client. (Solaris platform with Oracle 10g)

All other hours are either commuting, sleeping or playing [WoW][1]. Look forward to a number of upcoming posts on Dansguardian SQL logging, OpenBSD and of course Apple and the iPhone.

Zug Zug&#8230;. you [WC3][2] fans will know what I mean.
