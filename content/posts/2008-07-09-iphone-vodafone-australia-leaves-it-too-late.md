If Vodafone Australia don&#8217;t release their iPhone pricing/data or respond to my Pre-registration ASAP (and I mean by midday Wednesday only 48 hours before launch) I&#8217;m going to unfortunately have to go elsewhere.

What is the point of their pre-registration when:

  * One hears nothing back from it except a &#8220;Watch your inbox&#8221;
  * One goes into a Central Melbourne Vodafone shop and they say &#8220;We are not owned by Vodafone so don&#8217;t know about pre-registration or when the pricing is available&#8221;
  * One rings the Vodafone Connect number and can NOT find any option &#8211; menu &#8211; or area that will answer your iPhone questions
  * Optus and Vodafone 3G offerings outside Metro areas will use 900Mhz &#8211; **WTF Carriers**!

In fact their automated Phone system hung up on me twice and I gave up calling.

It looks like I&#8217;m going to have to go Telstra or Optus. Hmmmm. It may have to be Telstra since:

  * they have Nationwide 3G coverage using 850Mhz &#8211; iPhone supported
  * They will offer free WiFi access at their hotspots (aka any McDonalds)
  * It&#8217;s that easy to port my mobile numbers away from Vodafone

I know Telstra have yet to list their data usage pricing; but it can&#8217;t be as any worse than their previous offerings.

I will take this moment &#8211; for the first time &#8211; to note here that although I&#8217;m not a Telstra employee I currently work on their IT Transformation. So it may be in my best interest to &#8220;show company colours&#8221; around the office &#8211; and have my phone continue to work as I travel the lifts of the many Melbourne buildings.

Come on Vodafone &#8211; you will be losing a customer and $2000 a year in money spent on your services. As [other][1] [bloggers][2] and news outlets have mentioned, _they are cutting it too close_.
