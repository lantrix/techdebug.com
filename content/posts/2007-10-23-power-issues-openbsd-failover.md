Having had aircon installed today, my headless web server did not recover from the scheduled power outage. It was stuck in a stupid &#8220;Press F1 to Boot&#8221; screen, and as such Tech Debug was down for the majority of the day. Now I have it all back online it is time to consider two things:

  * A UPS
  * A secondary Web/DB server running OpenBSD

Does anyone know they best way to have a failover apache+mysql+postgres OpenBSD server?
