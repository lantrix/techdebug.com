I have been messing around with [feedburner][1]. It seems to offer a really good service for free, with some premium options if you choose to enable them. I have cut my feed over to it, as I get stats of who/when is subscribed. They also allow for funky embeded items (like the Digg and Email this links you see on each post).

Have you ever clicked on an XML/RSS feed in your browser and seen only xml code come up? They cater for that as well. If someone clicks on your syndication link via the (now standard) [feed icon][2], just like this [<img decoding="async" id="image18" src="https://techdebug.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/feed-icon-14x14.png" alt="RSS Feed Icon" />][3], AND they have no RSS viewer installed, nor a RSS capable browser, then they get a nice page explaining what syndication is, and how to subscribe. Good for my mum, and the less technical people in the world (hi mum!).

So using feedburner has been a good experience after all. All that there is left to do is redirect existing subscribers in apache to the new feed.
