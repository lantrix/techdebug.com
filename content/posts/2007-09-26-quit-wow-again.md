Looking in my inbox today I read this:

> This message is being sent to confirm that all credit card information has been removed from the World of Warcraft account \***\*****, effectively cancelling its recurring subscription as of September 23, 2007 5:47 AM UTC. The account will not bill or renew any further unless new payment information (credit card or game card) is manually entered in.  
> The account will remain playable for the remaining time it has already paid for.

So I did it&#8230; again. Cancelled. I was wasting money. Hadn&#8217;t played the game in weeks, and when I got on even with my mains and alts it was boring. I have BC expansion, but still am lvl 51 on my main, so I&#8217;ve never seen the new content except on the public test realms. Its all a pretty useless game at the moment. Having no one else I know who plays doesn&#8217;t help either.  
They do say:

> At this time, Blizzard has no plans to delete or &#8220;expire&#8221; characters, even if an account is deactivated

which means there will always be the nag in the back of my mind that I could go back &#8211; in fact they are betting on it. I think I&#8217;ll trade one addiction (WoW) for another (exercise) and I&#8217;ll be a lot healthier for it.
