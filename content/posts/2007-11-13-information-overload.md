Did you ever have too many RSS feeds you are subscribed to?  
Wasting your time posting updates to Flickr, Twitter, facebook, and so on?  
[This guy thinks he has the answers][1]. Cut out the IM and stop reading your email so often. Me? I just removed 70% of my news feeds in my reader, turned my phone off, and I&#8217;m going to bed to read a book (and get away from this blog for now).  
As for four hours a week working? I don&#8217;t think I can scale back to that yet &#8211; but it would be nice.
