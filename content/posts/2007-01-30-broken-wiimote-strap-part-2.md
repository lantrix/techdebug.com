I rang nintendo today and it was very painless to [order my free wiimote strap replacements][1]. They asked for the console serial number, the number of wiimotes, and told me to keep my old straps to send back. They will include a return envelope for me. Painless, quick, and finally we will soon be able to use our wiimote with straps again&#8230; It feels very unsafe swinging these things around without straps.
