Apple have released their [Apple TV][1]

<img decoding="async" src="http://images.apple.com/au/home/2007/01/promoappletv20070109.jpg" alt="Apple TV picture" /> 

My question, is why does Australia get CONSISTENTLY marked up prices from Apple? The Apple TV is USD$299, and AUD$449. At the current exchange rate of 1 USD to 1.28683 AUD this item costs AUD$385 when purchased in the US. That is over $60 more expensive for the pleasure of purchasing from Australia!

How do they justify this? The exchange rates do not fluctuate that much. Shipping to Australia surely does not cost this per unit? Surely they ship by the container load! Why? Why?

As much as I want one of these, with only a 40GB HDD, and a price tag of nearly half a grand, I will probably not be plonking down my hard earned cash.

Edit: I forgot the dreaded Goods and Service Tax (GST). Thanks John Howard. That still leaves a difference of AUD$26. That can&#8217;t all be shipping.
