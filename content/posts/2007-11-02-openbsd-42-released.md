The official OpenBSD announcement states:

> We are pleased to announce the official release of OpenBSD 4.2. We remain proud of OpenBSD&#8217;s record of more than ten years with only two remote holes in the default install. We dedicate this release to the memory of long-time developer Jun-ichiro &#8220;itojun&#8221; Itoh Hagino, who focused his life on IPv6 deployment for everyone.

So get to it people, [buy a CD and support the project][1]. While you are waiting for your CD to arrive, you can [get the release off the mirrors][2].  
I use this OS exclusively for all my servers, firewalls, www, db, dns and it is the quickest to set-up, easiest to administrate (great doco) and the most secure by default of any of the UNIX like operating systems out there.
