According to the [Download Squad][1] Google&#8217;s Gmail has just integrated IMAP. This in conjunction with the recent storage space is the second big thing for google in the mail arena in recent days. I applaud them for this move as the POP3 access they previously offered was great for desktop PC&#8217;s but difficult for mobile devices.  
I can confirm that it appears to be only in select accounts, because as of now, I still only have POP access.
