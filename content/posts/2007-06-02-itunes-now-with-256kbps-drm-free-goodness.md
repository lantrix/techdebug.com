A friend recently said he had been steering clear of the iTunes Music Store because of the low bitrate. This is even though he uses an ipod, mac and iTunes. I personally have purchased over 300 tracks at the previous 128Kbps bitrate, and up to now, have been happy with the quality of these AAC song files.

Now apple have released a (so far limited) portion of their catalogue, being from EMI at 256Kbps, and DRM free to top it off.

This audio review on digg says &#8220;Comparing these two compression rates was tough, even when using a pair of state-of-the-art Ultrasone headphones. In our decidedly unscientific comparison, we listened to all the tunes at both compression rates in A/B comparisons with those phones, with iPod stock earbuds, on our kick-ass car stereo, and on our reference Dolby 5.1 system.&#8221;

Will this be enough for people who previously avoided iTMS to give it a go, maybe not for whole albums, but for the one or two songs they might want to buy in a pinch? Will this be just easier for people to purchase a single song at a decent quality, instead of wasting 1/2 an hour searching through limewire or other sites for the song they want?

Time will tell.
