It looks like I may have successfully written an alpha &#8220;migrator plug-in&#8221; that may work for migrating your com\_google\_maps component from Joomla 1.0.x to 1.5.

Once I have tested this on the internal testbed migration sites for one of my customers, I will write it up here.  
This will be useful since the developer of the [Google Maps API][1] for joomla has no current migration plugins.

Stay tuned&#8230;.
