[Potent Spice Works to Block Growth of Melanoma in Lab Test][1]:

> &#8220;Curcumin, the pungent yellow spice found in both turmeric and curry powders, blocks a key biological pathway needed for development of melanoma and other cancers, say researchers from The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.&#8221;

So after a discussion with a friend yesterday, I&#8217;ll take the curry over the KFC if I&#8217;m eating out (Calorie count aside)!

Yes I know this is old news but it came up this weekend in conversation
