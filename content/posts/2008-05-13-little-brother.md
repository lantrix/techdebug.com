I just started reading Cory Doctorow&#8217;s **Little Brother** using one of his ebooks he has relesed under the Creative Commons license.  
I have to admit that I had never heard of Cory of BoingBoing fame, or his books until I read about them [via CelticBear][1].

As a &#8216;paranoid&#8217; geeked I&#8217;m hooked on Little Brother, and if you like tech, geek and drama you should [check it out][2] as well.

**Update:** I went to buy a copy from a local bookstore, but it is not released in Australia yet. You can read the [ebook][3] or buy it from [amazon][4].
