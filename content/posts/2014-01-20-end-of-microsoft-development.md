It has been a year from not blogging at all, due to a hectic professional schedule.

I&#8217;ve been busy dealing with BizTalk 2010, WCF services and all things SOA. One thing I&#8217;ve learnt is I&#8217;m not a hardcore developer. I&#8217;m much better at implementing technical solutions and server sysadmin. I think I&#8217;ll stick to that. In the meantime my knowledge and skill level with BizTalk has gone up now having almost 2 years experience developing, deploying and maintaining an ESB based around BizTalk 2010 and WCF services. It will be good to get back to Unix systems and Git source control instead of Wintel systems with TFS.
