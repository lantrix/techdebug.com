Departing from my tech theme, I _had to_ share this. This footage is so clear, and not just some blurry dot in the sky.

This footage was captured by crew members on board the current Shuttle Mission, [STS-120][1], after jettisoning the External Fuel tank. They use handheld cams to capture this footage for analysis of the tank, probably after [previous well known incidents of damage][2]. If you dont want to watch the whole thing, **fast forward to _2 mins 20 seconds_** to see what the talk is about!



_What IS that!_ It&#8217;s some sort of crystaline like structure that was tracking the tank, then went through the clouds. You can [continue to follow the discussion][3] about this video that was posted by ATS-38; a member of AboveTopSecret.com

**Edit:** there is a [copy of this footage][4] on YouTube as well.
