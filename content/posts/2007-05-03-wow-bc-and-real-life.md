Listening to Starman talk about his Arcane/Frost spec on [worldofwarcast][1] makes me want to hurry up and get a move on in this game. I&#8217;ve played the game since it came out in 2004, and my main char is a lvl 49 arcane mage, so why can&#8217;t I make it past lvl 60, and why can&#8217;t I even get into to the outlands? (I have the expansion).

Life.. that&#8217;s why. Family and a full time job too&#8230;

Looks like I have to live with that. At this rate I will probably be a lvl 70 some time in 2008.

Now back to listening to every podcast talk about life after lvl 70.
